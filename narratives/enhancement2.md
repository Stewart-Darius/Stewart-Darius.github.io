# Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact I selected for the Algorithms and Data Structures category is the same secure server application originally developed in CS-305. This artifact calculates SHA-256 hashes of input values. In the original version, the logic for hashing and input validation was minimal and not resilient to unexpected or invalid inputs.

For this enhancement, I focused on improving the efficiency and robustness of the input handling and hashing logic. I restructured the method responsible for processing incoming requests to include detailed input validation and exception handling. I also used Java's built-in libraries to efficiently process string-to-hash transformations and return results in a consistent, standardized format.

This enhancement demonstrates the application of algorithmic thinking to improve both performance and clarity. It aligns with the program outcome that emphasizes designing and evaluating computing solutions using appropriate standards and managing trade-offs.

Throughout the enhancement, I evaluated multiple options for parsing and validating inputs and chose an approach that balanced readability, security, and performance. I also added unit test coverage to verify that the algorithm behaves correctly for both valid and edge-case inputs. This process deepened my understanding of robust algorithm design, error handling, and safe data processing.
